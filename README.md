# ElementStringPicture
 Preparing a special teacher's day gift for my chem teacher

# Idea
Use Elements to form the picture, so that seen form afar is my Chemistry Teacher teaching\
I wish to draw the human protrait in some special chemicals, but that will be for updates later

# Approach

## 1. Sort symbol density
Create canvas, use PIL ImageDraw and count no. of black pixel.EZ\
This can be used for other projects, (*maybe math? which you measure greek letters...*)
## 2. Wordcloud?
Use the prebuilt python wordcloud lib  to colour a wordcloud to the colour of the picture.\
Result... I cannot distinguish any details.

## 3. "Boxing" via brute force
Before even doing it I know it will be hell of Time compextity
